## Projects
- **Divvy-Tripdata Database**

  This project builds a structured PostgreSQL database from the 2024 Divvy bike-share trip data (12 monthly datasets). The goal is to analyze ride behavior differences between **casual users** and **members**, focusing on both **temporal patterns** (daily, weekly, seasonal) and **spatial patterns** (stations, routes).

  The R Markdown workflow includes:
  - Connecting to PostgreSQL using R (`RPostgres`, `DBI`).
  - Importing and consolidating monthly CSV datasets into a single relational structure.
  - Defining tables with primary keys, timestamps, and station/user details to ensure data integrity.
  - Supporting analyses such as:
    - Ride duration trends
    - Station popularity
    - Route usage
    - User segmentation (casual vs. member)

  By creating this database, the project enables efficient querying, aggregation, and exploratory data analysis. The insights generated will help **Divvy optimize operations and guide marketing strategies**.
