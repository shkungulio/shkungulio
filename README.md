## Projects
### Divvy-Tripdata Database 2024

  I designed and implemented a fully normalized PostgreSQL database for the 2024 Divvy bike-share dataset — consolidating 12 monthly CSVs (6.5M+ records) into a scalable analytical environment.
This project combines ETL automation, database design, and exploratory analytics to uncover behavioral, temporal, and spatial patterns across Chicago’s bike network.

**Key Features**
* Schema design: Star-schema with dimension tables (dim_station, dim_date, dim_member_type, dim_bike_type) and a central fact_trips table.
* Normalization: Enforced 3NF integrity with foreign keys, CHECK constraints, and deduplication logic.
* Performance tuning: Optimized queries through time-, member-, and station-based indexes and materialized summaries.
* ETL automation: Dynamic R scripts using RPostgres, DBI, readr, and glue for reproducible data ingestion and transformation.
* Views for analytics: Created analytical views (e.g., vw_daily_counts, vw_weekly_counts, vw_top_start_stations) to support SQL- and R-based EDA.

**Insights**
* Members ride more frequently during weekdays and commute hours.
* Casual users peak on weekends and in summer, with longer ride durations (~30–40 min vs. ~10–12 min for members).
* Top stations: Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St.
* Seasonality: Sharp rise in ridership from spring to summer, tapering toward winter.

**Impact**

This database enables Divvy analysts to:
* Query millions of rides efficiently.
* Identify demand hotspots and behavioral trends.
* Support operational planning and marketing optimization.
* Extend analysis to predictive modeling and demand forecasting.
